"""
The program would like to display the number of grades, the average
grade, and the percentage of grades that are above the average grade
by accessing a file named Final.txt, which contains the students'
grades on the final exam. The program will be using two functions. 

The file will be open to get the grades and closed after the grades 
have been extracted.

The first function named main will start the application. 
The second function named calculate percent above average will 
calculate the percentage of grades that are above the average grade.
